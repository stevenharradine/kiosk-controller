Kiosk Controller
================

A CLI app and HTTP API to remotely control Chromium running in a kiosk mode.

Originally built for opening dashboards on TV-connected Raspberry Pis.

##Todo

- Implement HTTP API (likely through Python)
- Add option to disable HTTP API
- Clean up script code (also possibly change the CLI sub-command names)
